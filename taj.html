                The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.
                It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
                It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan, the builder.
                The tomb is the centerpiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years.
                The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million).
                The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>
                The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra.
                Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.
                An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above riverbank.
                In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.
                Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.
                The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.
                The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.
                It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.
                It took efforts from 22,000 labourer, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.
                The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.
                The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.
                In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble.
                According to the legend, Shah Jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold, and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight.
                A 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) tamped-earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons.
                An elaborate post-and-beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position. Water was drawn from the river by a series of purs, an animal-powered rope and bucket mechanism, into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank.
                It was passed into three subsidiary tanks, from which it was piped to the complex.
                The plinth and tomb took roughly 12 years to complete. 
                The remaining parts of the complex took an additional 10 years and were completed in order of minarets, mosque and jawab, and gateway.
                Since the complex was built in stages, discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on "completion". 
                Construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by 1643[8] while work continued on the outlying buildings continued for years. 
                Estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time.
                The total cost at the time has been estimated to be about 32 million Indian rupees,which is around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US) based on 2015 values.

         <p>
             <ul>  
                <li>It’s not a palace, but a mausoleum where Mumtaz and her admirer, the emperor Shah Jahan, are buried.</li>
                <li>The emperor Shah Jahan has interfered with every detail of the construction.</li>
                <li>According to the stories, the hands of all workers were cut off by Shah Jahan after completing the construction. This to ensure that they could not cooperate in building a possibly even more beautiful monument.</li>
                <li>It is without doubt the most beautiful monument in the world that was ever built out of love.</li>
                <li>That Emperor Shah Jahan is also buried here was not his intention. For himself he wanted a black variant of the Taj Mahal.</li>
                <li>It’s 58 meters high, 56 meters wide and stands on a 10,000 m² raised marble platform.</li>
                <li>The marble came from 160 km awayfrom the mines of Rajashtan.</li>
                <li>1,000 elephants have been used to transport this material.</li>
                <li>20,000 Indians have worked on the structure.</li>
                <li>Building it took 12 years.</li>
                <li>The material was obtained from India, Afghanistan, Tibet and Sri Lanka alongside India.</li>
                <li>The 4 minarets are intentionally skewed. This is to prevent them from falling over the Taj Mahal during a possible earthquake.</li>
                <li>It’s is an Islamic building and you can see this on the crescent moon that adorns the dome and the refined decorations that contain symbols from Islam.</li>
                <li>To make the building look as beautiful as possible, it was built on a plateau, so that you do not see anything at the back except for the air.</li>

         <h1>Myths</h1>
         <p>
                Ever since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.
                A longstanding myth holds that Shah Jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a Black Taj Mahal across the Yamuna river.
                The idea originates from fanciful writings of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a European traveller who visited Agra in 1665.
                It was suggested that his son Aurangzeb overthrew Shah Jahan before it could be built.
                Ruins of blackened marble across the river in Moonlight Garden, Mahtab Bagh, seemed to support this legend.
                However, excavations carried out in the 1990s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black.
                A more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in 2006 by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the Moonlight Garden.
                A dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.
                No evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.
                Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design.
                Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.
                No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble.
                Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.
                Another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth.
                To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.
                In 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.("counsel for the petitioner [...] withdrew the petition")
                In 2005 a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court.
                This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who says that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmar Dev in 1196.
                As of 2017, several court cases about Taj Mahal being a Hindu temple have been inspired by Oak's theory.
                In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.
