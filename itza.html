                Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period.
                The archaeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.
                Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200).
                The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.
                The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
                Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.
                The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.
                The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History).
                The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.
                Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.

         <!--Name And Orthography-->

         <h1>Name And Orthography</h1>
         <p>
                The Maya name "Chichen Itza" means "At the mouth of the well of the Itza."
                This derives from chi', meaning "mouth" or "edge," and chʼen or chʼeʼen, meaning "well."
                Itzá is the name of an ethnic-lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula.
                One possible translation for Itza is "enchanter (or enchantment) of the water," from its, "sorcerer," and ha, "water."
                The name is spelled Chichén Itzá in Spanish, and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable.
                Other references prefer the Maya orthography, Chichen Itzaʼ.
                This form preserves the phonemic distinction between chʼ and ch, since the base word chʼeʼen (which, however, is not stressed in Maya) begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant. 
                The word "Itzaʼ" has a high tone on the "a" followed by a glottal stop (indicated by the apostrophe).
                Evidence in the Chilam Balam books indicates another, earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the Itza hegemony in northern Yucatán.
                While most sources agree the first word means seven, there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest.
                This earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography, but it is represented variously as Uuc Yabnal ("Seven Great House"), Uuc Hab Nal ("Seven Bushy Places"), Uucyabnal ("Seven Great Rulers") or Uc Abnal ("Seven Lines of Abnal").
                This name, dating to the Late Classic Period, is recorded both in the book of Chilam Balam de Chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins.
                The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between 750 and 900 AD.
                Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula.
                The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.

         <h1>Facts</h1>
         <p>
             <ul>  
                <li>The term Chichen Itza means ‘the mouth at the well of Itza’. It is believed Itza means ‘water magicians’, deriving from the Mayan Itz for ‘magic’ and á for ‘water’.</li>
                <li>El Castillo (the Temple of Kukulkan) is the famous pyramid which dominates the site of Chichen Itza and it actually sits on another much older temple.</li>
                <li>Believed by archaeologists to have been a powerful economic city around 600 AD, the fall of Chichen Itza is thought to have been approximately 1000 AD.</li>
                <li>The design and layout of Chichen Itza was clearly well planned and builders constructed temples and pyramids in sets of clusters.</li>
                <li>The four most well known clusters are the Great North Platform, the Ossario Group, the Central Group and the Old Chichen, which is not open to the public. The Great North Platform is home to the most visited sites of Chichen Itza, including the Kukulkan Pyramid, the Great Ball Court and the Temple of the Jaguars.</li>
                <li>During the Spring (20th of March) and Autumn Equinox (22nd September), sunrays creates a shadow across the Kukulkan Pyramid that gives the appearance of a serpent slithering down the staircase.</li>
                <li>Located on the north side of the Kukulkan Pyramid is a platform dedicated to the planet Venus. The Mayans were devoted astronomers and the movements of Venus held special meaning to them, with it influencing the architecture of the ancient Mayan city Uxmal.</li>
                <li>Although the Kukulkan Pyramid is the most famous and most visited, there are numerous others in Chichen Itza. The Osario is very similar but smaller in size and at the centre is an opening to a natural cave.</li>
                <li>Many of the sites in Chichen Itza are known for their unusual sounds. If you clap once from one end of the Ball Court, it produces nine echoes in the middle of the court. Additionally, a clap in front of the Kukulkan Pyramid creates an echo resembling the serpent’s chirp.</li>

         <h1>Geography</h1>
         <p>
                Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities, with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi).
                Smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this.
                The city was built upon broken terrain, which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups, with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the Castillo pyramid, and the Las Monjas, Osario and Main Southwest groups.
                The site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation, and many have been restored.
                The buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways, called sacbeob.
                Archaeologists have identified over 80 sacbeob criss-crossing the site, and extending in all directions from the city.
                Many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red, green, blue and purple colors.
                Pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area.
                The site must be imagined as a colorful one, not like it is today.
                Just like gothic cathedrals in Europe, colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings.
                The architecture encompasses a number of styles, including the Puuc and Chenes styles of the northern Yucatán Peninsula.
                The buildings of Chichen Itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets, and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls.
                The three best known of these complexes are the Great North Platform, which includes the monuments of El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan), Temple of Warriors and the Great Ball Court.
                The Osario Group, which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the Temple of Xtoloc; and the Central Group, which includes the Caracol, Las Monjas, and Akab Dzib.
                South of Las Monjas, in an area known as Chichén Viejo (Old Chichén) and only open to archaeologists, are several other complexes, such as the Group of the Initial Series, Group of the Lintels, and Group of the Old Castle.
