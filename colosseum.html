                The Colosseum or Coliseum also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre or Colosseo is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built.
                The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus.
                Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96).
                These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).
                The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.
                The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era.
                It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
                Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World.
                It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.

         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>
                The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine Hills, through which a canalised stream ran.
                By the 2nd century BC the area was densely inhabited.
                It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain.
                He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site, in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions, gardens and porticoes.
                The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea.
                Cross-section from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (1904)
                Although the Colossus was preserved, much of the Domus Aurea was torn down.
                The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre.
                Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea.
                Vespasian's decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero's lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use.
                In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre, in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome.
                Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem.
                According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, "the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty."
                Along with the spoils, estimated 100,000 Jewish prisoners were brought back to Rome after the war, and many contributed to the massive workforce needed for construction.
                The slaves undertook manual labor such as working in the quarries at Tivoli where the travertine was quarried, along with lifting and transporting the quarried stones 20 miles from Tivoli to Rome.
                Along with this free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum.
                The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials: wood, limestone, tuff, tiles, cement, and mortar.
                Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around 70–72 AD (73–75 AD according to some sources).
                The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian's death in 79. The top level was finished by his son, Titus, in 80, and the inaugural games were held in AD 80 or 81.
                Dio Cassius recounts that over 9,000 wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre.
                Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration.

         <h1>Facts</h1>
         <p>
             <ul>  
                <li>The Colosseum was built between 72 A.D and 80 A.D under the Emperor Vespasian, in the heart of Ancient Rome.</li>
                <li>Made from stone and concrete, this magnificent monument was built with the man power of tens of thousands of slaves.</li>
                <li>The Colosseum is the largest amphitheater (meaning “theatre in the round”) in the world! Oval in shape, it measures 189m long, 156m wide and 50m high (about the height of a 12 storey building). This ancient sporting arena could easily fit a modern day football pitch inside!</li>
                <li>This brilliant building had 80 entrances and could seat approximately 50,000 spectators who would come to watch sporting events and games. These events included gladiatorial combats, wild animal hunts and, believe it or not, ship naval battles!</li>
                <li>Free for all! At the Colosseum’s major events – often those organised and paid for by the emperors themselves – there was no entry fee. And free food was sometimes served, too. Bonus! Emperors would use this as a way to gain popularity and support from the public.</li>
                <li>The events at the Colosseum were seriously brutal, though – during certain games held by the emperors around 10,000 animals were killed in a single day.</li>
                <li>The first games ever to be held were in 80 A.D, under Emperor Titus (the son of Vespasian), and they ran for 100 days straight. Games continued to be held for centuries to come – gladiatorial games until the fifth century and animal hunts until the 6th century.</li>
                <li>To protect the spectators from the blistering sun and heat of Ancient Rome, there was the velarium – an awning that could be pulled over the top of the seating area to provide shade.</li>
                <li>Below the Colosseum were numerous rooms and underground passages. Here is where the animals and gladiators were kept, waiting to meet their fate in the arena above. There were also 36 trap doors in the arena for special effects!</li>
                <li>Although two-thirds of the colosseum has been destroyed over time – mostly the result of vandalism, earthquakes and fires – it is today a popular tourist site, attracting thousands of people every year!</li>

         <h1>Restoration</h1>
         <p>
                In 2011 Diego Della Valle, head of the shoe firm Tod's, entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a €25 million restoration of the Colosseum.
                Work was planned to begin at the end of 2011, taking up to two and a half years.
                Due to the controversial nature of using a public–private partnership to fund the restoration, work was delayed and began in 2013.
                The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum's history.
                The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum's arcaded façade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground-level arches.
                Taking three years, the final product of this work was unveiled 1 July 2016, when the Italian minister of culture, Dario Franceschini, also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of 2018.
                These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for "cultural events of the highest level.
                The project also plans to create a services center and to restore the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum.
                New to tours of the restored marvel beginning 1 November 2017, the top two levels have been opened for guided visits. 
                The fourth level held the marketplace, and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens, the plebians, gathered and watched the show, bringing picnics for the day-long event.
