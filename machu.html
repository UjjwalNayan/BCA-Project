                Machu Picchu, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a 2,430-metre (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.
                It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District, above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.
                Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls.
                Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. 
                Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.

         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>
          In the Quechua language, machu means "old" or "old person", while pikchu means either "portion of coca being chewed" or "pyramid, pointed multi-sided solid; cone".
          Thus the name of the site is sometimes interpreted as "old mountain".
          Machu Picchu was built starting 1450–1460.
          Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).
          There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for himself, most likely after a successful military campaign.
          Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. 
          Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.
          It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.

             <ul>  
                <li>One of the Seven Wonders of the World.</li>
                <li>No wheels were used to transport heavy rocks for the construction of the city.</li>
                <li>Structures were built with a technique called “ashlar.” Stones are cut to fit together without mortar. Remarkably, not even a needle can fit in between two stones.
                <li>The citadel is divided in two parts: Hanan and Urin according with the Inca tradition.</li>
                <li>In the Quechua native language, “Machu Picchu” means “Old Peak” or “Old Mountain.”</li>
                <li>Many of the stones that were used to build the city weighed more than 50 tons. How did these stones get up the mountain? Some were chiseled from the granite bedrock of the mountain ridge. For others, hundreds of men pushed the heavy rocks up the steep mountain side.</li>
                <li> On the Inca Trail, many porters sleep with a shiny metal object or mirror beneath them. They believe it sends away spirits coming up through the earth and whisks them away. Ask any guide or porter, and most will tell you that sometimes they have experienced the feeling of being pulled out of their tents by spirits of the past.</li>
                <li>The exact age of Machu Picchu, the most representative and ancient city of Peru, has been clarified by scientific studies on the geology and archaeology of the site.</li>
                <li>Can you imagine the size and scale of Machu Picchu? The sanctuary is located in the district of Machu Picchu, in the province of Urubamba in the department of Cusco. The site is South America’s most impressive archaeological ruin.</li>
                <li> Many people ask: why is Machu Picchu so important? The Citadel of Machu Picchu is considered the main tourist attraction in Peru and one of the most visited worldwide.</li>

         <h1>Geography</h1>
         <p>
            Machu Picchu lies in the southern hemisphere, 13.164 degrees south of the equator.
            It is 80 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 metres (7,970 feet) above mean sea level, over 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which has an elevation of 3,400 metres (11,200 ft).
            As such, it had a milder climate than the Inca capital.
            It is one of the most important archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.
            Machu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the majority of the annual rain falling from October through to March.
            Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450 metres (1,480 ft) to the river at their base.
            The area is subject to morning mists rising from the river.
            The location of the city was a military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided natural defenses.
            The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for the Inca army.
            Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu, the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that measures 6 metres (20 ft).
            The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and Huayna Picchu, with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly impassable mountain at its back.
            It has a water supply from springs that cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to provide more farmland to grow crops and to steepen the slopes that invaders would have to ascend.
            The terraces reduced soil erosion and protected against landslides.
            Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other across the Inca bridge.
            Both could be blocked easily, should invaders approach along them.
