        <h1>Thanks for visiting our site.</h1>
        <p>Greetings dear! I'm Ujjwal Nayan. I made this website with my best effort and under the guidance of my supportive teachers. After gaining some expirence in this field I found that, with over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>
        <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications but also try to meet all the requiremnts of the customer.</p>

            <p>In 2001 an initiative was started by the Swiss corporation New7Wonders Foundation to choose the New7Wonders of the World from a selection of 200 existing monuments through online votes.
                 The Great Pyramid of Giza, the only remaining of the Seven Ancient Wonders, was not one of the winners announced in 2007 but was added as an honorary candidate.

            <h2>New7 Wonders Of Nature</h2>
            <p>New7Wonders of Nature (2007–2011) was an initiative started in 2007 to create a list of seven natural wonders chosen by people through a global poll. It was the second in a series of Internet-based polls led by Swiss-born Canadian Bernard Weber and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation,a Swiss-based foundation which Weber founded. 
                The initiative followed an earlier New7Wonders of the World campaign, and attracted 100 million votes from around the world before voting finished on November 11, 2011.
