                Petra, originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu, is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan.
                Petra lies on the slope of Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
                Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC, and it was possibly established in the 4th century BC as the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom.
                The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
                The trading business gained the Nabataeans considerable revenue and Petra became the focus of their wealth.
                The earliest historical reference to Petra was an attack to the city ordered by Antigonus I in 312 BC recorded by various Greek historians.
                The Nabataeans were, unlike their enemies, accustomed to living in the barren deserts, and were able to repel attacks by utilizing the area's mountainous terrain.
                They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving.
                Petra flourished in the 1st century AD when its famous Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of Nabataean King Aretas IV – was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.
                Although the Nabataean Kingdom became a client state for the Roman Empire in the first century BC, it was only in 106 AD that they lost their independence.

         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>
                By 2010 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a pre-pottery settlement just north of Petra.
                Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela or Seir.
                Though the city was founded relatively late, a sanctuary has existed there since very ancient times.
                Historian Josephus (ca. 37–100) describes the region as inhabited by the Madianite nation as early as 1340 BC, and that the nation was governed by five kings, whom he names: "Rekem; the city which bears his name ranks highest in the land of the Arabs and to this day is called by the whole Arabian nation, after the name of its royal founder, Rekeme: called Petra by the Greeks."
                The famed architecture of Petra, and other Nabataean sites, was built during indigenous rule in early antiquity.
                The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.
                They became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished.
                Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by modern scholars.
                Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.
                The Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, remains unknown.
                The passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC is understood to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the "petra" (rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name and the description implies that the metropolis was not yet in existence, although its place was used by Arabians.
                The Rekem Inscription before it was buried by the bridge abutments.
                The name "Rekem" was inscribed in the rock wall of the Wadi Musa opposite the entrance to the Siq.
                However, Jordan built a bridge over the wadi and this inscription was buried beneath tons of concrete.

         <h1>Geography</h1>
         <p>
                Pliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Tadeanos and the center of their caravan trade.
                Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.
                Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis.
                The area is visited by flash floods, and archaeological evidence demonstrates the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns and water conduits.
                These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.
                The narrow passage (Siq) that leads to Petra.
                In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun ("Aaron's Mountain"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial-place of Aaron, brother of Moses.
                Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north.
                Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east.
                The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge (in places only 3–4 m (9.8–13.1 ft) wide) called the Siq ("the shaft"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.
                At the end of the narrow gorge stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, Al Khazneh (popularly known as and meaning "the Treasury"), hewn into the sandstone cliff.
                While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumored to be hidden within it.
                A little further from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view.
                At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect.
                The theatre has been cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction.
                Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-colored mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.
